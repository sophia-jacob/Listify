What my project does:
It is a website for those who want to be a bit more organized. It includes features like a to-do list, timer to help study, notes section, and a calendar where you can keep track of events.

Why I made the project:
I tend to be a bit disorganized with all the tasks that I have to do as when I write them down, they tend to be in different apps. This website helps put it all together to help be more organized.

How I made it:
I used HTMl for the basic elements on the page. CSS was used for the styling which made up a lot of the features. JavaScript was the language I used for making the features interactive.

What I struggled with/learned:
I struggled with making sure that all the information stored in the website doesn't go away when the page refreshes, which is why I had to learn JavaScript a bit more in depth. It ended up being a fun learning process.
